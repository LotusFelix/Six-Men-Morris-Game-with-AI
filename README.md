# Six-Men-Morris-Game-with-AI
This repository contains an implementation of the classic Six Men Morris game using AI search techniques to simulate intelligent decision-making.

The AI leverages strategies like Mini-Max, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search to enable autonomous systems to choose optimal actions in adversarial settings.

The game is designed to showcase key concepts in AI such as adversarial search and game theory, and provides a challenging environment for testing these algorithms.
